# Iris Flowers Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the **Iris Flowers Classification** project! This Jupyter Notebook-based project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. We'll use a machine learning algorithm for this task, making it a great starting point for those interested in classification problems and species identification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flowers-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd iris-flowers-classification
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flowers_Classification.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the code, load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal is to classify each iris flower into one of these species based on its measurements.

## Model

In this project, we utilize a classification algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers. Several classification algorithms are suitable for this task, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees. The choice of algorithm may vary based on your preferences and the dataset size.

## Results

After training the classification model, you can evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model classifies iris flowers into their respective species.
